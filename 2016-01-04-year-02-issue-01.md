**Happy New Year** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

I hope you started the new year in the best possible way, and that are as recharged and fired up as I am to make 2016 an amazing year.

Before getting started with this week's most interesting projects I have a favour to ask. I put together a [very quick survey](http://goo.gl/forms/EsbRm3Tkmr), won't take more than 2 minutes, and I would be incredibly helpful if you could go through it. It will help me build a better and more useful The iOS Times and [mokacoding.com](http://mokacoding.com). Thank you so much!

## [OptionalExtensions](https://github.com/RuiAAPeres/OptionalExtensions)

A small framework by [Rui Peres](https://twitter.com/peres) that adds useful methods to the Swift's `Optional` type, like `filter`, `apply`, and `replaceNil`.

## [Filterpedia](https://github.com/FlexMonkey/Filterpedia)

[FlexMonkey](https://twitter.com/FlexMonkey/), aka Simon Gladman, is back with an open source iPad app showcasing the Core Image filters range and capabilities. The app is intended to be a companion for his upcoming book "Core Image for Swift"

## [VWInstantRun](https://github.com/wangshengjia/VWInstantRun)

This interesting Xcode plugin will let you build and run selected lines of code and see the output in the Console. This could be a good alternative to trying code in a Playground, although less powerful. I am a big fun of exploring code using a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop), and in other communities, like the [Clojure](http://clojure.org), this approach is at the core of the development process.

## [TTPasteHistory](https://github.com/tutumagi/TTPasteHistory)

This week we have another useful Xcode plugin. TTPasteHistory lets you bring up the your clipboard history for a more powerful copy-pasting experience. If you'd like to be able to access you copy-paste history across apps I would recommend using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

## [react-native-watch](https://github.com/conorbuck/react-native-watch)

A work in progress repository containing React Native bindings for WatchKit.

## Other Interesting Projects

* [SwiftString](https://github.com/erica/SwiftString) A small library of Swift String utilities, built for the Swift Package Manager.
* [LunarCalendar](https://github.com/fancymax/LunarCalendar) A Swift Lunar Calendar app for OS X
* [SwiftRefresher](https://github.com/morizotter/SwiftRefresher) A pull to refresh control alternative to `UIRefreshControl`.
* [360Controller](https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller) XBox 360 Controller driver for Mac OS X
