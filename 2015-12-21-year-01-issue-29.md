## [Whisper](https://github.com/hyperoslo/Whisper)

This library provides a simple API to display in-app messages to the user.

```swift
let message = Message(title: "Enter your message here.", color: UIColor.redColor())
Whisper(message, to: navigationController, action: .Present)
```

Shout(announcement, to: self)
```

```

## [Perfect](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect)

With the announcement of open source Swift the interest on building web application using it grew a lot, and with the great reveal two weeks ago that became a reality. Perfect is a framework that makes this possible, and already has a big community and a set of components library. The possibility of building the backend for your next iOS app using the same language of the app itself is very appealing... You should definitely check this library out.

## [Awesome-Swift-Education](https://github.com/hsavit1/Awesome-Swift-Education)

Learning is a core part of what makes a good software developer. This curated list of learning resources for Swift is a great place where to start.

## [AppVersionMonitor](https://github.com/muukii/AppVersionMonitor)

This little library wraps the logic to get the application version and compare it with a previously stored one.

```swift
switch AppVersionMonitor.sharedMonitor.state {
case .Installed:
case .NotChanged:
case .Upgraded(let previousVersion: AppVersion):
case .Downgraded(let previousVersion: AppVersion):
}
```

## [KeyboardObserver](https://github.com/morizotter/KeyboardObserver)

This library provides a simplified way to handle keyboard events in a Swifty style. You can _observe_ the state of the keyboard, and handle changes through a closure using a state enum you can switch on.

## [Swift-Flow](https://github.com/Swift-Flow/Swift-Flow)

Swift Flow is a [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)-like implementation of the unidirectional data flow architecture in Swift. The concepts of unidirectional data flow are getting more and more attention in the functional programming world, and their users cannot stop blogging about the benefits they get from it.

Taking good ideas from other programming languages and frameworks and incorporating in ours is a recipe for growth. Thanks Benjamin Encz for starting working on this.
