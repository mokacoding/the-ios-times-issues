## [Bolts-Swift](https://github.com/BoltsFramework/Bolts-Swift)

The [Bolts Framework](https://github.com/BoltsFramework) team has started porting Bolts for iOS to Swift. At the moment only the `Task` component is available, but I'd suggest to keep an eye on the repo for future developments.

## [PeekPop](https://github.com/marmelroy/PeekPop)

A library to make the "Peek and Pop" functionality available only to devices with 3D touch to older ones, and work with it using a transparent API.

## [SPTPersistentCache](https://github.com/spotify/SPTPersistentCache)

The [Spotify team](https://twitter.com/spotifyeng) shared their take to the caching problem. `SPTPersistenCache` is a [LRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#LRU) cache to store `NSData` with time to live values and semantics for disk management.

It also comes with a super handy companion Mac app GUI tool to inspect the contents of any `SPTPersistentCache`.

## [NumberMorphView](https://github.com/me-abhinav/NumberMorphView)

This nice view library displays numbers and animates their transitions using [tweening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening).

## [Sweetcorn](https://github.com/FlexMonkey/sweetcorn)

Sweetcorn is an OS X app which implements a node based user interface to create Core Image Shader Language code. The resulting code can be used as the basis for custom Core Image filters for either OS X or iOS.

This app has been developed by [Simon Gladman aka @FlexMonkey](https://twitter.com/FlexMonkey), that in the past months has been sharing a ton of great resources in the field of image manipulation, and even [published a book](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/core-image-for-swift/id1073029980?mt=11) on the topic. Thanks Simon!

## [SwiftImageProcessing](https://github.com/skyfe79/SwiftImageProcessing)

An speaking of image processing, this project by [Sungcheol Kim](http://blog.burt.pe.kr/), contains a collection of Playgrounds demoing simple and not so simple image processing features in Swift

## [react-native-ios-charts](https://github.com/Jpadilla1/react-native-ios-charts)

This library is a port of [iOS-Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/ios-charts), which is a port of [MPAndroidCharts](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart), to React Native. The port is not 100% complete, but there are already a good number of charts available.

## [SmarkDown](https://github.com/SwiftStudies/SmarkDown)

A "pure" Swift [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) implementation. Interesting the choice of the author to only publish the library via SPM.

## [LeagueofLegends](https://github.com/HarrisHan/LeagueofLegends)

An iOS App for [League of Legends](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/)  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
