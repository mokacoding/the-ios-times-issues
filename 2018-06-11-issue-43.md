Last week was _the week_ for Apple developers: WWDC week! Apple revealed a whole range of improvements, new APIs, and tools. The sessions are available [here](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/). There's something for everyone.

It took little to no time to the open source community to ship libraries using the new goodies.
