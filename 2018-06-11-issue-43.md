### Before we begin

Hi, it's been... a while ðŸ˜³. You know, life happens, other projects come up, momentum is lost. I realise you might have [signed up for the newsletter]() and never received anything. That must have been disappointing.

**Why writing again?** To be honest, I'm not sure. I just know that I feel like The iOS Times was doing something cool, and is worth keeping alive. Newsletter subscribers grew 33% during the time I haven't been publishing. Makes me feel like there's people interested in this, and is worth pursuing.

**How to make this sustainable?** I can't promise I'll be able to keep up a weekly schedule. In the time since [the previous issue](http://theiostimes.com/year-02-issue-12.html) I became a dad (_best thing in my life ever!_), moved from contracting to a day job, and started a few projects on the side. I'll try to write weekly, but you might not hear from me every now and again.

After all this time you might actually want to unsubscribe from this. That's totally cool. I know the feeling of having too many newsletters to catchup with. I hope you'll stay along for the ride though.

Now that we've gotten that out of the door... Let's get into the most interesting open source projects released in 2018 so far.
