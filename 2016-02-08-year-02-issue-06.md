## [SwiftString](https://github.com/amayne/SwiftString)

We can all agree that the Swift's `String` type APIs are not as powerful as we'd like them to be. This library extends `String` extending it with a rich set of methods, there's one from every need, from `trimmed()` to `latinize()`.

## [TRON](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON)

A framework abstracting network connection and result parsing into a straightforward API:

```
let request: APIRequest<Issue,MyAppError> = tron.request(path: "latest")
request.performWithSuccess( { issue in
  // ...
}, failure: { error in
  // ...
})
```

TRON will get you started in no time when working with server exposing RESTful APIs, is built on top of the solid [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) and [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON), it supports plugins and request stubbing for tests purposes.

## [RxOptional](https://github.com/thanegill/RxOptional)

If you are using Functional Reactive Programming with [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) you'll like library. RxOptional extends `Optional` providing _operators_ that can be used with `Observable`s containing it, like `filterNil()`, `replaceNilWitl()`, `errorOnNil()`, and more. There is also an `Occupiable` protocol for types like `Array` and `Dictionary` that provides similar operators but in the empty form, like `filterEmpty()`.

## [blackfish](https://github.com/elliottminns/blackfish)

Blackfish is an HTTP web server that aims to be _insanely fast_, and ports the style of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) famous [Express](http://expressjs.com/) web server to Swift. The README states that the project is still a work in progress, but you might want to have a look at it nevertheless. I am really excited by all these projects being shared that try to push the language in directions other than app development, it is a great way to see what Swift is capable of.

## [CoreDataDandy](https://github.com/fuzz-productions/CoreDataDandy)

This library is a wrapper around Core Data providing APIs to simplify common operations such as initialising stacks, the CRUDs operations and JSON serialization. It also provides supports four extra xcdatamodel attributes, and optional console logging. You can write code like:

```
Dandy.fetchObjectsForEntity("Dandy")

Dandy.save {
    // Respond to save completion.
}
```


## [Fusuma](https://github.com/ytakzk/Fusuma)

An Instagram-like ready to use `UIImagePickerController` replacement.

## [Yep](https://github.com/CatchChat/Yep)

This open source app for the [Yep](https://soyep.com/) chat platform, a "_community where geniuses meet_" (ü§î‚ùì) is quite interesting as it uses a ton of third party libraries. You should have a look at its [Podfile](https://github.com/CatchChat/Yep/blob/master/Podfile) to see if you have any in common and have a look at how they are using them, you'll probably find inspiration.

## [LayoutTest-iOS](https://github.com/linkedin/LayoutTest-iOS)

The [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) team is always innovating and sharing great open source code. This new library for testing the behaviour of your views when configured with different data and under different screen resolutions. The library can also perform some automatic tests, such as no subviews overlap, all subviews contained within superview, and even some accessibility sanity checks. More info [here](https://linkedin.github.io/LayoutTest-iOS/).

I have mixed feelings on the actual value of testing view components, but I'm definitely interested to see where this library will go and what the community will do with it now that it has been open sourced.

## [FoldingCell](https://github.com/Ramotion/folding-cell)

This `UITableVIewCell` subclass reveals more content when tapped with a delightful unfold animation:

Be warned though, such niceness requires quite a lot of configuration.
