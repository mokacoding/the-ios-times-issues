Hello friends, I hope you had a nice and refreshing weekend. Before starting with this week's issue I'd like to give a shout out to [awesome-ios](https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios) a GitHub project where you can find great libraries solving any kind of problems you could have when developing an app, a great place to go to find inspiration.

And now, let's get started with another great collections of projects covering full blown apps, CS projects, an little UI components ðŸ˜Ž.

## [WWDCTV](https://github.com/azzoor/WWDCTV)

The WWDC videos are one of the primary sources of best practices for developers in the Apple platforms. WWDCTV not only allows you to watch the videos from the comfort of your couch, but being open source is a good way to have a look at how write an application for Apple TV

## [Revert](https://github.com/revealapp/Revert)

The [Itty Bitty Apps](http://ittybittyapps.com/) team has open sourced this app the use as test for [Reveal](http://revealapp.com/), a wonderful runtime view hierarchy inspection tool. Play around with Revert to see examples common UI elements as well as very complex scenarios. All written in Swift 2 of course.

_Full disclosure:_ I am currently working with Itty Bitty Apps, so I might be a bit bias... But seriously Revert and Reveal are great projects you should definitely check out.

## [Dunk](https://github.com/naoyashiga/Dunk)

An here's another open source app. Dunk is a [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) client, you can download it from the App Store, or have a look at the code for examples of network requests involving images.

## [luft](https://github.com/k0nserv/luft)

A useful Xcode plugin to help you keeping your project `UIViewController`s leaner. If your class is nice and short the Xcode gutter will be green, turning yellow when the view controller is growing a bit too much. The gutter will finally turn red when it's time for you to do some refactoring, maybe extracting logic and responsibilities from the view controller.

## [SwiftAlgorithmsClassroom](https://github.com/gmertk/SwiftAlgorithmsClassroom)

This is a very interesting project, although only at its inception. Swift Algorithms Classroom aims to be a virtual classroom to learn the basics on algorithms and data structures applied to Swift.

"Every few days an assignment will be given by creating an issue. You will fork this repository and send a pull request as your solution to the issue. We will do peer-review by commenting others' solutions. We will learn and teach all together."

You should participate.

## [Swift-AI](https://github.com/collinhundley/Swift-AI)

Talking about CS, here's another new born project, this time focused on Artificial Intelligence. The road map includes a number of AI topics to implement, and at the moment you can look into the implementation of a [Feed-Forward Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network).

## [GooeyTabbar](https://github.com/KittenYang/GooeyTabbar)

Ok, enough with the academia, let's have a look at some neat UI. GooeyTabbar is a cheerful way to provide a navigation menu accessible from a tabbar to your users, with a _gooey-wobblying_ presentation animation.

## [SFFocusViewLayout](https://github.com/fdzsergio/SFFocusViewLayout)

The easiest way to explain what this library does is by showing an example:

![SFFocuseViewLayout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fdzsergio/SFFocusViewLayout/master/Screenshots/SFFocusViewLayout.gif)

This is an interesting concept, and could be exactly what you are looking for if you are developing something like a portfolio application.

## [VolumeControl](https://github.com/12Rockets/VolumeControl)

A custom volume control UI, neat and polished.

## [SwiftyButton](https://github.com/TakeScoop/SwiftyButton)

A `UIButton` subclass exposing APIs that make customizing its appearance easier

* [HTY360Player](https://github.com/hanton/HTY360Player) A player for 360Â° videos.
* [MGSwipeTableCell](https://github.com/MortimerGoro/MGSwipeTableCell) An easy to use `UITableViewCell` subclass that allows to display swippable buttons with a variety of transitions.
* [MTPrivateTrainerAnimation](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTPrivateTrainerAnimation) A gorgeous animated onboarding concept and implementation.

## Still Hot From Last Week ðŸ”¥

* [EZSwiftExtensions](https://github.com/goktugyil/EZSwiftExtensions) Rich collection of opinionated Swift's extensions to write simpler code.
