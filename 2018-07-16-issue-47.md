### [Preferences](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Preferences)

This library by "full-time open-sourcerer" [Sinder Sorhus](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus) promises to let yo add a preferences window to your macOS app in minutes.

"Just pass in some view controllers and this package will take care of the rest."

### [Twig](https://github.com/lukakerr/twig)

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and it's [GitHub Flavoured](https://github.github.com/gfm/) extension are my favourite way to write text. I've been writing this publication in `.md` files from [the very first issue](http://theiostimes.com/year-01-issue-01.html).

Twig by [Luka Kerr](https://lukakerr.github.io/) is a very promising Markdown editor app for macOS, and what's even better: it's open source.

### [SwiftierSwift](https://github.com/SwifterSwift/SwifterSwift)

A community driven collection of more than 500 Swift extensions to get more out of the standard library, Foundation, UIKit, AppKit, and other Apple frameworks.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend installing the whole package, but I'm sure looking at the source you'll find something useful and inspiring.

### [FuzzCheck](https://github.com/loiclec/FuzzCheck)

"_A coverage-guided engine for Swift packages that works with typed values instead of raw binary buffers_".

In other words, given a test function `(Input) -> Bool`, it tries to find values of `Input` that will trigger edge cases in your code, and does it in a performant way.

Author [LoÃ¯c Lecrenier](https://twitter.com/loiclec) warns that the project is not ready for production yet. It would be great to see where this tool can go to help with automated testing and finding bugs.

### Other interesting projects

- [icns2png](https://github.com/louisdh/icns2png). Swift script converting `.icns` to `.png` of various sizes.
- [Bartinter](https://github.com/MaximKotliar/Bartinter). Dynamically changes status bar style depending on content behind it.

Thanks for reading [The iOS Times](theiostimes.com).

I love **helping developers getting more done**, whether by highlighting useful open source libraries, sharing [Xcode tips and tricks](http://xcodetips.com/), or leveraging [testing and automation](http://www.mokacoding.com/).

So here's a question for you:

**What is your biggest struggle right now with building software?**

I read every single email that I receive. Looking forward to hear what you have to say. ðŸ˜‰.
