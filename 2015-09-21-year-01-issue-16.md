Hello friends, and a warm welcome to all the new subscribers. The list has seen a great growth during the last week, and I am very thankful for that ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Let's get started!

## [SBShortcutMenuSimulator](https://github.com/DeskConnect/SBShortcutMenuSimulator)

**Language: Swift**

The new iPhones will ship soon, but in the meantime you can add 3D Touch shortcuts to the Simulator using this library.

It works by injecting a `dylib` in the running instance of the Simulator, which will allow you simulate the 3D touch to reveal the shortcuts menu by sending the bundle id to `127.0.0.1:8000`.

And speaking of 3D Touch have a look at [InceptionTouch](https://github.com/richzertuche/InceptionTouch) and [Pseudo3DTouch](https://github.com/b3ll/Pseudo3DTouch) which emulates tracking force touch on older devices.

## [TVPong](https://github.com/aerickson14/TVPong)

**Language: Swift**

An implementation of the classic Pong, using SpriteKit, for tvOS.

## [Watchdog](https://github.com/wojteklukaszuk/Watchdogk)

**Language: Swift**

A class for logging excessive blocking on the main thread. It observes the run loop and detect any stalling or blocking that occurs. Very useful when developing interactive applications.

```
üëÆ Main thread was blocked for 1.25s üëÆ
```

## [stampicon](https://github.com/jorystiefel/stampicon)

**Language: Swift**

A CLI tool to imprint a text banner over a PNG icon. It uses CoreGraphics, rather than requiring a dependency such as ImageMagick, which makes it well suited for build servers.

This is how the result looks like:

## [Refactor the Mega-Controller](https://github.com/andymatuschak/refactor-the-mega-controller)

**Language: Swift**

[Andy Matuschak](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak) gave [a talk at Realm](https://realm.io/news/andy-matuschak-refactor-mega-controller/) and [NSSpain](http://nsspain.com/2015/) showing how to "_take a highly-coupled, highly-ugly view controller implementation and to incrementally isolate, abstract, and test components of it, reducing dependencies of each piece along the way."_

The repository shows the code used in the NSSpain version of the talk. The code by itself doesn't make a lot of sense without the context of the talk, which I'd highly recommend you to watch.

## [iOS-9-Sampler](https://github.com/shu223/iOS-9-Sampler)

**Language: Swift**

Code examples for the new features in iOS 9. Worth having a look at it just for the README, which as animated demos of each new feature.

## [Fuzi](https://github.com/cezheng/Fuzi)

**Language: Swift**

XML and HTML parser, aiming to be lightweight and fast. It is mostly based on [Ono](https://github.com/mattt/Ono), with a Swiftier touch.

## [MTMaterialDelete](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTMaterialDelete)

Visually impactful delete animation, probably not very usable, but remarkable indeed.

## [RateLimit](https://github.com/soffes/RateLimit)

**Language: Swift**

Simple utility for only executing code every so often, fully thread-safe.

```swift
RateLimit.execute(name: "RefreshTimeline", limit: 60) {
  // Do some work that runs a maximum of once per minute
}
```

## [DAExpandAnimation](https://github.com/ifitdoesntwork/DAExpandAnimation)

**Language: Swift**

A custom modal transition that presents a controller from a list with an expanding effect while sliding out the other cells.

## [Cakebrew](https://github.com/brunophilipe/Cakebrew)

**Language: Objective-C**

A Mac app to control your [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) formulae. I am a big terminal fan, but I can see the appeal of such a tool.
