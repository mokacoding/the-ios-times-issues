Hello all! This has been a very special week. Two great events: [The iOS Advent Calendar](http://theiostimes.com/advent-calendar.html) launched, and at last Swift has been open sourced ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

As such this is going to be a very special issue.

### Open Source Swift

Apple open source Swift on the 3rd of December, with a number of repos on [GitHub](https://github.com/apple) and a dedicated website, [swift.org](https://swift.org/).

The Swift language itself can be found [here](https://github.com/apple/swift), and all the commit history is there, revealing that "the future started 5 years ago", with the first commit dated 18 July 2010.

The whole of Foundation is going to be re-written in Swift, providing OS independence. The process has already started, and you can find the repo [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation). XCTest will be ported as well, have a look [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest).

Another big news is the official Swift [Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager), with both [@mxcl](https://twitter.com/mxcl) and [@mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) working on it.

Finally not only we get to have a look and contribute to the development of today's Swift, but also tomorrow's with the [Swift Evolution repo](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution) where the Swift team is laying down the blueprint for Swift v3.0.

The repositories of the [Apple organization on GitHub](https://github.com/apple) have a lot more to offer and to teach, be sure to check them out.

### The iOS Advent Calendar - Days 1 to 6

On the 1st of December to we launched "[The iOS Advent Calendar](http://theiostimes.com/advent-calendar.html)" to celebrate the upcoming Christmas season ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ…. In case you missed them here's the first 6 issues:

1. [Alamofire](http://theiostimes.com/advent-calendar/alamofire.html), elegant networking for Swift.
1. [Chameleon](http://theiostimes.com/advent-calendar/chameleon.html), a library to generate and manipulate colors.
1. [SwiftLint](http://theiostimes.com/advent-calendar/swiftlint.html), run this tool to generate warning and errors when the code style doesn't match your team's conventions.
1. [Async](http://theiostimes.com/advent-calendar/async.html), syntactic sugar for better and chainable asynchronous operations.
1. [Static](http://theiostimes.com/advent-calendar/static.html), write maintainable static table views with ease.
1. [AMScrollingNavbar](http://theiostimes.com/advent-calendar/amscrollingnavbar.html), shrink the navigation bar when scrolling table views.
