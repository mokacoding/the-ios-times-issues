Hello everyone, hope you had a nice weekend and that you're ready to dig in into this week's hottest repos.

Before starting I'd like to plug two events happening in Australia very soon, which you might want to look at. The first is [YOW! Connected](http://connected.yowconference.com.au/speakers/) a mobile and IOT conference, the second [NSCamp](http://www.nscamp.com/) a social weekend for iOS and OS X developer in the beautiful and secluded Broken Bay Sport and Recreation Centre in NSW.

## [ActiveLabel](https://github.com/optonaut/ActiveLabel.swift)

**Language: Swift**

A `UILabel` automatically recognizing URLs, hashtags, and at mentions (@).

## [LiquidFloatingActionButton](https://github.com/yoavlt/LiquidFloatingActionButton)

**Language: Swift**

Material design, floating action button, in _liquid state_.

## [SwiftLocation](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftLocation)

**Language: Swift**

A Swift API wrapping CoreLocation.

```swift
SwiftLocation.shared.currentLocation(Accuracy.Neighborhood, timeout: 20, onSuccess: { (location) -> Void in
    // location is a CLPlacemark
}) { (error) -> Void in
    // something went wrong
}
```

I find particularly interesting how the accuracy has its own enum, with possible values: `Country`, `City`, `Neighborhood`, `Block`, `House`, `Room`.

## [Locksmith](https://github.com/matthewpalmer/Locksmith)

**Language: Swift**

Protocol-oriented library for working with the iOS Keychain. Something that makes this library different from the others is that it provides access to all of the keychainâ€™s metadata in a type-useful way via `ResultType` protocols, so you can save an `NSDate`, get an `NSDate` back, without needing to typecast.

## [ProtocolKit](https://github.com/forkingdog/ProtocolKit)

**Language: Objective-C**

Adds Swift's protocol extension capability to Objective-C code.

## [NSGIF](https://github.com/NSRare/NSGIF)

**Language: Objective-C**

Library to create animated GIFs from MOV files.

## [APNGKit](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit)

**Language: Swift**

Framework to render and play APNG, animated PNG, images on iOS with a focus on performances.

## [DGRunkeeperSwitch](https://github.com/gontovnik/DGRunkeeperSwitch)

**Langauge: Swift**

Two segments control inspired by [Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/), and with nice spring animations

## [Chirp](https://github.com/trifl/Chirp)

**Language: Swift**

Library providing simple API to play sounds.

```swift
Chirp.sharedManager.prepareSound("boop")
Chirp.sharedManager.prepareSound("ding.mp3")

if somethings {
  Chirp.sharedManager.playSound("boop")
} else {
  Chirp.sharedManager.playSound("ding.mp3")
}

Chirp.sharedManager.removeSound("boop")
Chirp.sharedManager.removeSound("ding.mp3")
```

## [natal](https://github.com/dmotz/natal)

**Language: many**

Command-line utility that automates most of the process of setting up a React Native app running on [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript).

## [gl-react-native](https://github.com/ProjectSeptemberInc/gl-react-native)

OpenGL bindings for react-native to implement complex effects over images and components, in the descriptive VDOM paradigm.
