## [XLPagerTabStrip](https://github.com/xmartlabs/XLPagerTabStrip)

The [Xmartlabs](http://xmartlabs.com/) team is back on GitHub with a port to iOS of Android's [PagerTabStrip](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/view/PagerTabStrip.html). This library is straightforward to use, and has plenty of visual customizations, along with 4 different stock styles for you to choose from.

## [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon)

Hammerspoon is a window manager and desktop automator app that allows you to define keyboard shortcuts performing any sort of action by scripting them in [Lua](http://www.lua.org/). You can resize windows, move them around the screen, load a number of apps in given positions at the same time, interact with the UI of an app, and much more, have a look at this [comprehensive getting started guide](http://www.hammerspoon.org/go/).

As a side note, I've been using [Mjonir](https://github.com/sdegutis/mjolnir), on which Hammerspoon is base, for a long time, and really encourage to take a couple of hours to automate the management of your windows, it will save you a lot of time in the long run.

## [URLNavigator](https://github.com/devxoul/URLNavigator)

 URLNavigator provides a nice API to navigate through view controllers by URLs. The first use case that comes to mind is to handle app launches from [custom URLs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Inter-AppCommunication/Inter-AppCommunication.html), but you can use URLs to navigate between controllers from within your application as well.

```swift
Navigator.map("myapp://home", HomeViewController.self)
Navigator.map("myapp://post/<id>", PostViewController.self)

Navigator.map("myapp://alert") { URL, values in
    print(URL.parameters["title"])
    print(URL.parameters["message"])
    return true
}
```

## [AlamofireNetworkActivityIndicator](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireNetworkActivityIndicator)

This library lets you manage the visibility of the network activity indicator on iOS _automagically_ with a single line of code. The activity indicator will be shown and hidden automatically when requests made through [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) will start and finish.

## [Reel Search](https://github.com/Ramotion/reel-search)

This library refreshes something as usual as picking a value from a list by dressing it with an original and pleasant UI.

## [trySwiftApp](https://github.com/NatashaTheRobot/trySwiftApp)

The [try! Swift](http://www.tryswiftconf.com/en) conference will start in two weeks, but you don't have to wait for the its app, it is already available on GitHub.

## [CRParticleEffect](https://github.com/Cleveroad/CRParticleEffect)

This library simplifies the creation of particle effects into a handful of lines of code.

## [Element](https://github.com/eonist/Element)

If you really cannot stand Interface Builder, or only know CSS and want to start designing OS X applications, then you'll find this library very interesting. Element is a UI framework for OS X applications that aims to empower developers to draw UIs in an alternative way.

A great amount of went into this project with dozens of UI components already supported, and custom built SVG engine, css engine, and vector draw engine.

## [Stevia](https://github.com/s4cha/Stevia)

Speaking of UI frameworks, Stevia is a UI layout library for iOS that aims to provide a simpler API than Auto Layout. It also provide an ingenious take on the visual layout language made up of custom operators (_whether that's a good idea it is another question_ ðŸ˜³):

```
layout([
	100,
	|-email-| ~ 80,
	8,
	|-password-| ~ 80,
	"",
	|login| ~ 80,
	0
])
```
