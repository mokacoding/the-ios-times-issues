## [Prephirences](https://github.com/phimage/Prephirences)

Library to manage application preferences in an easy an powerful way, and elegant as well since it is based on protocols. Not only you can read an write preferences, but also [apply operators](https://github.com/phimage/Prephirences#apply-operators-to-one-preference), like `+=` in place, and [composing different preferences origins together](https://github.com/phimage/Prephirences#composing). The list of supported preferences includes `NSUserDefaults`, `NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore`, Plist files, and `NSManageObject` as well.

## [PhoneNumberKit](https://github.com/marmelroy/PhoneNumberKit)

Framework for parsing, formatting and validating international phone numbers, adopting Swift 2's `throw` _pattern_.

```swift
do {
    let phoneNumber = try PhoneNumber(rawNumber:"+33 6 89 017383")
    let phoneNumberCustomDefaultRegion = try PhoneNumber(rawNumber: "+44 20 7031 3000", region: "GB")
}
catch {
    print("Generic parser error")
}
```
It is inspired by Google's [libphonenumber](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber), and the tests suite runs against the same example numbers.

## [Zephyr](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Zephyr)

Library to synchronize `NSUserDefaults` over iCloud. It allows sync of all the values, or only specific ones, and monitoring of values in the background to sync them as they change.

```swift
Zephyr.sync()
Zephyr.sync(["MyFirstKey", "MySecondKey"])
Zephyr.addKeysToBeMonitored(["MyFirstKey", "MySecondKey"])
```

## [YYWebImage](https://github.com/ibireme/YYWebImage)

For the same author of the project above, an asynchronous image loading library, claiming to be an improved replacement for SDWebImage, PINRemoteImage and FLAnimatedImage. It comes with its own cache support, can decode WebP, APNG, and GIF, displays a blurred low res version of the image while fetching it, has the usual `UIImageView` category, and much more.

## [YALField](https://github.com/Yalantis/YALField)

A set of views that can be used in Interface Builder to visually build forms. The library doesn't stop at the visual part, but also provides validators, formatters, and other form util classes that can be dropped in IB and connected with the fields.

![YALField Screenshot](https://s3.amazonaws.com/theiostimes/YALField.png)

There is a rich choice of form fields, as you'll see in the [README](https://github.com/Yalantis/YALField#yalfield).

## [Armchair](https://github.com/UrbanApps/Armchair)

A library to prompt the user for review (if you really thing that's a good idea), for both iOS and OS X, written in Swift, with closure callbacks, and supporting iTunes affiliate codes. The README has a very comprehensive documentation of what this library does.

## [FixCode](https://github.com/neonichu/FixCode)

From the README: This Xcode plugin disables the Fix Issue functionality in Xcode. This way, none of your team members can click this button by mistake and might end up revoking existing certificates and provisioning profiles. _That's a great idea, the tricky part will be making your team mates install the plug-in on their machines_ ðŸ˜¶
