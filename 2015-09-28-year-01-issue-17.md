Hello there! I hope you had a good week, and that you [verified your version of Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09222015a). Fun fact, I considered adding the [XcodeGhost source](https://github.com/XcodeGhostSource/XcodeGhost) to last week's list of projects, but decided against it.

Big news: The iOS Times finally has its own Twitter handle: [@_theiostimes](https://twitter.com/_theiostimes) ðŸŽ‰ Go there and hit follow ðŸ˜‰

Heaps of interesting projects this week, for those keen on UI, those looking for design patterns examples, and every one else in the in between. Let's get started!

## [Neon](https://github.com/mamaral/Neon)

A framework to programmatically the arrangement and sizing of UI views, particularly useful when building layouts with relative sizing and positioning.

![Neon demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mamaral/Neon/master/Screenshots/demo.gif)

I like the author's idea that: "_ We're not robots, so why should we build our UIs like we are?_", but I'm not sure if using frame math rather than AutoLayout under the hood is a good idea.

## [Run](https://github.com/khoiln/Run)

A Swift Wrapper for Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) supporting method chaining.

```swift
Run.background { () -> Void in
  for index in 1...UInt64.max{
      print(index)
  {
}.main { () -> Void in
  print("Back to main thread")
}
```

## [CoreDataStack](https://github.com/bignerdranch/CoreDataStack)

[The Big Nerd Ranch](https://www.bignerdranch.com/) CoreData stack, updated to Swift 2. More info on the stack design and how to use it can be found [here](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/introducing-the-big-nerd-ranch-core-data-stack/).

A word of advice as a former [MagicalRecord](https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord) user. Using these stack is useful to get started quickly, but nothing will replace the understanding of a framework a developer gets when using it himself.

## [HackingWithSwift](https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift)

A collection of project examples from the [hackingwithswift.com](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) book. A big thank you to the author [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) which decided to open source the code and release all the rest of the content for free once he had earned enough to cover the costs. What a good example of giving back to the community!

## [BlockParty](https://github.com/krishkumar/BlockParty)

An open source implementation of content blocking app. There has been a lot of buzz around these apps and the implication on the market recently, [this](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/09/ad-blocking.html) and [this](http://idlewords.com/talks/what_happens_next_will_amaze_you.htm) are good reads on the topic.

If you want to compare implementations have a look at [this "troll" implementation](https://github.com/schwa/DeckDick) by [schwa](https://twitter.com/schwa).

## [STPopup](https://github.com/kevin0571/STPopup)

A library to use a `UINavigationController` like controller inside a popup.

## [RACMarbles](https://github.com/samritchie/ReactiveMarbles)

A Playground showcasing [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa)'s features using streams of moving marbles.

## [EXTView](https://github.com/recruit-mtl/EXTView)

A collection of `UIKit` views subclasses with enhanced Interface Builder configuration options thanks to `IBInspectable` and `IBDesignable`.

## [Blurable](https://github.com/FlexMonkey/Blurable)

Simple library that adds `blur()` and `unBlur()` methods to `UIView`, which applies/removes a Core Image Gaussian blur filter to the contents. It is implemented using Swift 2's protocol extension.

## [zulip-ios](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-ios)

[Zulip](https://zulip.org/) is an open source group chat, born as a [Dropbox Hack Week project](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/09/open-sourcing-zulip-a-dropbox-hack-week-project/), with a set of useful feature for code discussion, and this is their open source iOS client. As you know I am a big fan of looking at other people app's code, so I could not not feature this project.

An speaking of open source apps, they team at [Artsy](http://artsy.github.com/open-source/) just started working on a new open source app with code name [Emergence](https://github.com/artsy/Emergence). There is not a lot to look there yet, but knowing the quality of the code they produce is worth bookmarking ðŸ˜‰.

## Other Interesting Projects

* [SCTableViewCell](https://github.com/SergioChan/SCTableViewCell) cell with swipe to delete effect like iOS Mail app.
* [PSOperation](https://github.com/pluralsight/PSOperations) a Swift 2 version of the sample code provided in the [Advanced `NSOperation` session of WWDC 2015](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=226), with improvements and fixes.
* [ZSeatSelector](https://github.com/richzertuche/ZSeatSelector) tool to generate seat map layouts, just in case you'll need to build a iOS client for a plane company.

## Still Hot From Last Weeks ðŸ”¥

* [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke) frameworks for loading, caching, processing, and displaying images.
* [Watchdog](https://github.com/wojteklukaszuk/Watchdog) a class for logging excessive blocking on the main thread.
* [iOS9-Adapation-Tips](https://github.com/ChenYilong/iOS9AdaptationTips) collection of snippets and explanation on how to support iOS 9 on existing codebases.
* [Chameleon](https://github.com/ViccAlexander/Chameleon) feature packed colors framework for iOS, with very nice defaults.
