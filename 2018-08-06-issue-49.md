### [DifferenceKit](https://github.com/ra1028/DifferenceKit)

A "fast and flexible" diffing library with _O(n)_ complexity for Swift collections shared by [Ryo Aoyama](https://twitter.com/ra1028fe5). Based on [Paul Heckel's algorithm](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359467) which other famous libraries use as well.

It comes with `UITableView` and `UIVCollectionView` extensions to implement incremental updates based on the evaluated diff.

### [Cabbage](https://github.com/VideoFlint/Cabbage)

[Vito Zhang](https://twitter.com/NoairZhangwei) shares a video composition framework based on `AVFoundation` aiming to provide an easier to use API.

### [PasswordRules](https://github.com/NSHipster/PasswordRules)

Library by [Mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) for defining strong password generator rules to combine together, as described in the recent [NSHipster](https://nshipster.com) article "[Password Rules / UITextInputPasswordRules](https://nshipster.com/uitextinputpasswordrules/)".

### [TopicEventBus](https://github.com/mcmatan/TopicEventBus)

An implementation by [Matan Abravanel](http://www.matanabrava.com/) of the [publish-subscribe pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) for topic-based systems.

The author also has a [post on Medium](https://medium.com/swift2go/why-you-should-stop-using-notificationcenter-and-start-using-topiceventbus-c4c7ab312643) arguing that this pattern is better than using `NSNotificationCenter`.

Amazon's AWS has a number of tools and services [based on pub-sub](https://aws.amazon.com/pub-sub-messaging/), even if you're keen on `NSNotfication`s this is definitely a topic worth exploring.

### Other Interesting Projects

- [literary-screensaver](https://github.com/disposedtrolley/literary-screensaver), a macOS screensaver showing the time in text form extracted by quotes from books.
- [GoogleMD-Icons](https://github.com/adamgolczak/GoogleMD-Icons), a collection of icons from the Google Material Design pack.
- [source-editor](https://github.com/louisdh/source-editor), a source editor for macOS and iOS. It's pretty basic at this point in time, but looks like it's easy to extend, could be a good project to contribute to.
