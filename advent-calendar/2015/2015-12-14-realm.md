One requirement almost every apps has, in one form or the other, is data persistence. Any app with a minimum complexity will probably need a database.

Apple provides us with [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/library/tvos/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html), an object model layer framework that is as powerful as it is hard to master.

Today I'd like to introduce you to a Core Data alternative. [Realm](https://realm.io) is a database designed for mobile devices, and with an open source driver thought for Swift.

Let me show you just enough code to get you interested in Realm.

### How to define a simple model

Do you remember the model used in the examples from [Alamofire](http://theiostimes.com/advent-calendar/alamofire.html) and [JSONCodable](http://theiostimes.com/advent-calendar/jsoncodable.html)? A post resource has an id, a user id, a title, and a body. We can write it as a Realm object model like this:

```swift
class Post: Object {
  dynamic var id: String = NSUUID().UUIDString
  dynamic var userId: String = NSUUID().UUIDString
  dynamic var title: String = ""
  dynamic var body: String = ""
}
```

We can create an instance of `Post` like any other Swift class:

```swift
let post = Post()
post.title = "any title"
post.body = "once upon a time..."
```

### How to persist and fetch data

Now that we have a `post` instance we can persist in it the realm database with this simple command:

```swift
do {
  let realm = try Realm()

  try realm.write {
    realm.add(post)
  }
} catch {
  // handle error somehow
}
```

Note that `Realm()` provides us with the _default_ realm database interface, [have a look at the documentation](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#other-realms) to see how to get a connection with other types of realms.

Also note how we need to `try` both the realm instantiation and write operation, I told you Realm embraces Swift, didn't I? ðŸ˜Ž

We can then query the database for posts with APIs like:

```swift
// all objecs
realm.objects(Post)

// sort based on a property
realm.objects(Post).sorted("title")

// sort based on a closure
realm.objects(Post).sort { postA, postB in
  // ...
}

// filter using a predicate
let predicate: NSPredicate = // ...
realm.objects(Post).filter(predicate)
```

A database wouldn't be very useful without relationships though, let's see how to describe relationships using Realm.

### How to define relationships using Realm

Let use better modelling for our posts, and create a User entity. A user can have many posts, but a post can have only one user.

```swift
class User: Object {
  dynamic var id = NSUUID().UUIDString
  dynamic var username = ""

  let posts = List<Post>()
}

class Post: Object {
  dynamic var id: String = NSUUID().UUIDString
  dynamic var user: User?
  dynamic var title: String = ""
  dynamic var body: String = ""
}
```

You can set the `post -> user` relationship simply by assigning a value to the `user` property of the `Post` instance.

You can set the `user -> posts` relationship using the `append` method of the Relam `List` type:

```swift
user.posts.append(newPost)
```

### Next Steps

As I've said at the beginning, the point of this tutorial was to show you enough code using Realm to get you curious. If I've succeeded in my intent and you want to know more head over to [Realm Swift's documentation](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/) and [the project's repo on GitHub](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa). As usual you can checkout [the example code used in this tutorial](https://github.com/mokacoding/AdventCalendar2015) and experiment with it. Finally, if you are wondering how to unit tests code interfacing with Realm, [I wrote a post about it on mokacoding.com](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/testing-realm-apps/).
