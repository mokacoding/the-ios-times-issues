As we're approaching the end of our 2015 iOS Advent Calendar the library I chose for today's tutorial has a practical use, but mainly wants to be inspirational.

[Result](https://github.com/antitypical/Result) by [Rob Rix](https://twitter.com/rob_rix) is an implementation of the _Result monad_ in Swift.

This type is similar to the standard Swift's `Optional`, but carries more information with it:

```swift
enum Result<T, Error: ErrorType> {
  case Success(T)
  case Failure(Error)
}
```

As you can see result has a `Success` and a `Failure` state, both with an associated value. `Success` can hold a generic value `T`, while `Failure` an error.

### How to use Result in Swift

`Result` can be used as the return type of a function executing an operation that can either succeed or fail, for example:

```swift
func somethingThatCanFail() -> Result<String, NSError>

switch somethingThatCanFail() {
case .Success(let string):
  print(string)
case .Failure(let error):
  print(error.localizedDescription)
}
```

As you can see this is quite similar to Swift `throw`, but `Result` allows us to leverage [higher order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) like `map` and `flatMap`.

For example, say we have a function fetching a JSON describing a pizza:

```swift
func fetchJSON() -> Result<[String: AnyObject], NSError>
```

And another function that given a JSON returns a pizza:

```swift
func pizzaWithJSON(JSON: [String: AnyObject]) -> Pizza
```

We can combine the two using `map`, obtaining an object of type `Result<Pizza, NSErorr>`:

```swift
let pizzaResult = fetchJSON().map(pizzaWithJSON)
```

We can then switch on this result like any other:

```swift
switch pizzaResult {
case .Success(let pizza):
  servePizza(pizza)
case .Error(let error):
  apologizeToCustomerWithError(error)
}
```

The power of this approach is in the function composition enabled by `Result` implementing `map`, `flatMap`, and other higher order functions. This enables you to build your software as a collection of small, self-contained, and easy to reason about functions and then compose them together.

### Next Steps

As I said at the start, with this little article I hope to inspire you to think outside the conventional object oriented box, and start exploring the possibilities offered by other paradigms like functional programming.

If you want to find out more about Result and how to use it head over to the [project's page on GitHub](https://github.com/antitypical/Result).

The library's author has published a number of other implementation of functional concepts in Swift, which you can find at [antitypical.github.io](https://antitypical.github.io/).

If you want to experiment more, [Swiftx](https://github.com/typelift/swiftx) and [Swiftz](https://github.com/typelift/swiftz) are bigger libraries implementing many functional programming features.

[Functional Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/functional-swift/) is a great book to learn about functional programming and see it applied to everyday iOS development in Swift.

[Maybe Haskell](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/maybe-haskell-our-newest-book) is another great book, that focuses on the `Maybe` Haskell type, which is the equivalent of Swift's `Optional`. This book helped me a lot understanding the concept of functor and monad, and their application via `map` and `flatMap`.

The videos from the last [Functional Swift Conf](http://2015.funswiftconf.com/) have just been released, and you can also watch the talks from [last year](http://2014.funswiftconf.com/).

Finally you might want to use your functional skills in a _reactive_ approach. [Functional Reactive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming), FRP for short, is a programming approach where almost everything is modelled as "_a stream of signals over time_", on which functional operations like `map`, `flatMap`, `throttle`, `zip`, `concat`, etc. can be applied. [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/), and [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) are two frameworks implementing these concepts.
