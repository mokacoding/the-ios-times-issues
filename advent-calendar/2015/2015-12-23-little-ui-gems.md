With only two days of The iOS Advent Calendar left I want to squeeze as much goodness as I can in the last two posts. As such, today is post is not going to be a tutotrial but a collection of UI components to amuse you and your users, and inspire some outside of the box thinking

The list has no particular order.

## NVActivityIndicatorView

[NVActivityIndicatorView](https://github.com/ninjaprox/NVActivityIndicatorView) is a collection of 30 and counting activity indicators.

Using one of the indicator views is very easy, only one line of code required.

## UIViewXXYBoom

[UIViewXXYBoom](https://github.com/xxycode/UIViewXXYBoom) allows you to _explode_ views with a nice animation. Very good for removing items from a list with style.

## BubbleTransition

No explanation needed.

Checkout this library's [homepage on GitHub](https://github.com/andreamazz/BubbleTransition).

## WZDraggableSwitchHeaderView

Since we're talking about transitions, what do you think about [WZDraggableSwitchHeaderView](https://github.com/wongzigii/WZDraggableSwitchHeaderView)?

This library is thought in particular for iPhone 6s' screens, where is almost impossible to reach the navigation bar while holding the phone with only one hand.

## BAFluidView

[BAFluidView](https://github.com/antiguab/BAFluidView) allows you to add a view that behavies like a moving fluid.

![BAFluidView Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antiguab/BAFluidView/master/readmeAssets/example2b.gif)

You can customize the appearance and behaviour of the view, for example to use it as a loading animation, or to tilt the fuild using the device accelerometer.

## LTMorphingLabel

A colleciton of morphing `UILabel`s. Checkout [the project's README on GitHub](https://github.com/lexrus/LTMorphingLabel) for a full list of the available animations.

### DOFavouriteButton

Cute animated buttons.

Checkout this library's [homepage on GitHub](https://github.com/ninjaprox/NVActivityIndicatorView).

### CKWaveCollectionViewTransition

[CKWaveCollectionViewTransition](https://github.com/CezaryKopacz/CKWaveCollectionViewTransition) is a visually impressive way to transition between one level and the next or previous in a hierarchical `UICollectionView`.

### TVButton

Use [TVButton](https://github.com/marmelroy/TVButton) to mimic the parallax views of the Apple TV.

![TVButton Demo](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fadb2b07c4e04e35288c3625f389f5d961fc10b9/687474703a2f2f692e67697068792e636f6d2f785469546e43714c35617259485739324c752e676966)

### DGElasticPullToRefresh

Some UX designers argue that pull-to-refresh might not be the best refresh mechanism to provide our app's users, but it is almost a standard nowadays.

With [DGElasticPullToRefresh](https://github.com/gontovnik/DGElasticPullToRefresh) you can add a touch of originality to your refresh experiences.

### Next Steps

The libraries featured in this post are only some of the vast collection of UI awesomeness that the open source community has released.

If you are looking for more visual components the website [CocoaControls]() has new ones every week.

I hope this post will leave you amused, and with a renewed will for experimenting with subtle UI/UX eye-candies that will surprise and delight your users.
