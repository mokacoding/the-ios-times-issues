Today we are going to have a look at a _"do only one thing but do it well"_ UI library. And as with most UI libraries a picture is better than a 1000 description words:

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreamazz/AMScrollingNavbar/master/assets/screenshot.gif)

[AMScrollingNavBar](https://github.com/andreamazz/AMScrollingNavbar) is made by [Andrea Mazzini](https://twitter.com/theandreamazz), one of the [most prolific](https://github.com/andreamazz?tab=repositories) open source authors in our community.

This UI effect is most useful in applications presenting long scrolling content that is more important than the navigation bar buttons.

### How to integrate AMScrollingNavbar

Adopting this fancy navigation bar behaviour in your app is very simple, there are only two steps required.

Firstly you need to make the navigation controller a subclass of `ScrollingNavigationController`, here's how to do it in a Storyboard:

![How to set the proper navigation controller subclass from Storyboard](https://s3.amazonaws.com/theiostimes/advent-calendar-2015-scrollingnavicationcontroller-storyboard.png)

The second step consist in configuring the scrolling behaviour at the view controller level:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
	super.viewDidLoad()

	if let navigationController = self.navigationController as? ScrollingNavigationController {
		navigationController.followScrollView(tableView, delay: 50.0)
	}
}
```

As easy as that ðŸ˜Ž.

### How to react to the navigation bar changes

If you need to perform some custom logic when the navigation bar changes state you can conform to `ScrollingNavigationControllerDelegate`:

```swift
extension ViewController: ScrollingNavigationControllerDelegate {
  print("Merry Christmas")
}
```

### Next Steps

AMScrollingNavbar is another great example of small and sharp focused library, a trend that is becoming more and more common in Swift and that will definitely result in code that is easier to compose and maintain.

This library is also a great example of how documentation should be written, and how to use Swift's access level to your advantage.

Head over to [the project repository on GitHub](https://github.com/andreamazz/AMScrollingNavbar) to read the code and find out more ways to configure AMScrollingNavbar, or jump to [this tutorial's companion project](https://github.com/mokacoding/AdventCalendar2015) to get your hands dirty in the code.
