Today we are talking about rendering GIFs üòÅ

[AnimatedGIFImageSerialization](https://github.com/mattt/AnimatedGIFImageSerialization) by [Mattt Tomphson](https://twitter.com/mattt), is probably the tinies library we've seen so far, but boy what awesome results it brings.

### How to display GIFs in iOS apps

A simple `import AnimatedGIFImageSerialization` will allow you to display GIF in your `UIImageView`s.

```swift
imageView.image = UIImage(named: "awesome.gif")
```

That easy. Classic Mattt.

If you want to find out more about this little great library, and look into how to gcreate an animated GIF and encode it into `NSData`, head over to [the project's repo on GitHub](https://github.com/mattt/AnimatedGIFImageSerialization).
