Regular expressions are hard, today framework doesn't make them easier, but at least provides a nice Swift syntax around them.

[Regex](https://github.com/sharplet/Regex) by [Adam Sharp](https://twitter.com/sharplet) is another great example of small sharp focused (_no pun intended_) Swift library that does only one thing, but well. The author defines it a Âµframework.

Regex provides a swifty APIs around Foundation's `NSRegualrExpression`. Let's see some example usages of Regex

### How to validate an input against a Regex

```swift
let input = "a pile of poo"

if Regex("(poo|poop)").matches(input) {
  print("Sorry you cannot use banned words")
}
```

### How to access the captured matches of a regex

```swift
let dirtyString = "There is a lot of poo in this place"
let bannedRegexString = "(poo|poop)"

Regex(bannedRegexString).match(dirtyString)?.captures.forEach { captured in
  print("Sorry the word \(captured) is not allowed")
}
```

And finally, pattern matching like a boss

```swift
switch someTextFromTheInternet {
case Regex("DROP DATABASE (.+)"):
  // TODO: patch security hole
default:
  break
}
```

I hope this little tutorial on this little library showed you something useful you could leverage in your next projects, but also motivated you to create similar microframewors.
