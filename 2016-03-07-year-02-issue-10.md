## [Advance](https://github.com/storehouse/Advance)

This framework, originally developed for the [Storehouse](https://www.storehouse.co/) app, aims to help writing advanced animations and physics-based interaction using a simple API, using `CADisplayLink` under the hood. The project README clearly states that you should look into Advance only if the animations you are trying to implement are not basic ones.

> Advance shines when:
>
> -You are building gesture-based interactions that use physics to reflect the behavior of the real world.
> -You need to animate custom types with per-frame callbacks.

## [BTree](https://github.com/lorentey/BTree)

Fast ordered collections, implemented using in-memory B-Trees. The project includes implementations of `Map<Key, Value>`, `List<Element>`, `OrderedSet<Element>`, and of course `BTree<Key, Payload>`. Your application might not require a B-Tree, but I would still recommend you have a look at the project's README as its well written and goes into the details of B-Trees and their performances.


## [Tentacle](https://github.com/mdiep/Tentacle)

Tentacle is a GitHub API built using [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa). I suggest you take a look at it as an example of how to wrap a server API using RAC, you'll be surprised of how simple it is, and how portable the result is.

```swift
let client = Client(.DotCom, token: "â€¦")
client
    .releaseForTag("tag-name", inRepository: Repository(owner: "ReactiveCocoa", name: "ReactiveCocoa"))
    .startWithNext { release in
        print("Downloaded release: \(release)")
    }
```

## [Markoff](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Markoff)

This open source app will render markdown files and automatically reloads it when the file changes. I really like the idea of having an always up to date preview of the markdown I'm writing without having to leave my text editor of choice.

## [Greedo Layout for iOS](https://github.com/500px/greedo-layout-for-ios)

A library for `UICollectionView` layout that computes what size the cells should be to display images in a variable height fixed aspect ratio grid.

## [EZTextSpace](https://github.com/goktugyil/EZTextSpace)

I'll let the project's testimonials describe it for you:

## [WatchdogInspector](https://github.com/tapwork/WatchdogInspector)

This handy debugging library shows your app frame rate in the status bar, and color codes it making it red when it goes below 60fps.
