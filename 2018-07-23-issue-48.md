### [Swift NIO Transport Services](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio-transport-services)

Earlier this year Apple released [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) an event-driven networking library, "_a low-level tool for building high-performance networking applications in Swift_.".

This week they open sourced this extension library to support Apple platforms as "first-class citizens". This is done via the [Network.framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network). Notice that this is only available on macOS 10.14+, iOS 12+, and tvOS 12+.

### [RxCoordinator](https://github.com/quickbirdstudios/RxCoordinator)

A reactive navigation framework based on the Coordinator pattern by [Joan Disho](https://twitter.com/_disho) and Stefan Kofler from [Quick Bird Studios](https://quickbirdstudios.com/index.php). You can use it to implement a fully Rx driven [MVVM-C architecture](https://tech.trivago.com/2016/08/26/mvvm-c-a-simple-way-to-navigate/).

### [Nano Blocks](https://github.com/nebyark/nano-blocks)

Brothers [Benjamin](http://atlasv.bandcamp.com/) and [Tim](http://www.timkray.com/) share an open source iOS wallet app for the [Nano cryptocurrency](https://nano.org/en).

![üì∏ screenshots of the app](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/901bc99f567c3346760d653e7a6a834b41cb9243/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6c646d395565572e6a7067)

_Never heard of Nano... maybe I should start The Cryptocurrencies Times_ ü§î.
